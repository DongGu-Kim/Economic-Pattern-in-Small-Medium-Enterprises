It\u2019s being billed as a giant leap in home healthcare \u2013 but critics say it will lead to huge numbers of people getting told they have heart problems when they don\u2019t. The Series 4 watch will go on sale in the US later this month costing $399, Apple announced at the product launch yesterday, calling the device \u201can intelligent guardian for your health\u201d. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is normally just available in hospital. Pads put onto your chest detect your heart\u2019s electrical activity, which is shown as the well-known spiky line on a monitor. Now Apple Watch users will be able to get an ECG at the touch of a button, by putting a finger on the \u201cdigital crown\u201d on the watch\u2019s side, similar to the winder on a clockwork watch. After 30 seconds, you get told if the result is normal or suggests a problem, and the recording can be shared with a doctor. The last Apple Watch could also be used to take an ECG if paired with a device called a Kardia Band, but this had to be bought separately. Having the function built into the watch will mean many more people will start regularly taking their ECG, especially if they worry about their health \u2013 and that\u2019s where problems may start. The feature will be useful for some people, namely those who have a condition called atrial fibrillation, where the heart beats irregularly, causing symptoms such as breathlessness, tiredness and chest pain. They sometimes need home monitoring. But many people have an irregular heart rhythm without symptoms. They will be told by their watch to take the ECG result to a doctor. They could then get potentially risky surgery, go on unnecessary medications risking side effects such as dizziness. At the \u00a0least they will be falsely alarmed. Several trials have investigated whether it is helpful to give ECGs to people without symptoms and the US Preventive Services Task Force has concluded that the evidence fails to show this approach does more good than harm. New Scientist has asked Apple if the company has any specific measures to avoid misdiagnosis, but has yet to receive a response. Another function, the intermittent heart rate monitor \u2013 which works though sensors built into the back of the watch face \u2013 may also have potential for false alarms. For instance, some people get panic attacks, when stress makes their heart and breathing rate race.

Now we can do the reverse, \u00a0turning droplets into bubbles, with a blast of sound. Researchers have already shown it is possible to suspend small particles, such as droplets, in the air by counteracting gravity with pressure from ultrasound waves. Duyang Zang at Northwestern Polytechnical University, China, and his colleagues have now discovered that higher sound pressure can create a bubble from a levitating droplet. The team placed a drop of soap solution between an acoustic levitator, a pair of emitting and reflecting panels that pump out sound. They increased the pressure on the droplet by gradually turning up the volume, pushing it into a flat film and then curving it into a bowl that filled with air. Once the air in the bowl reached a certain volume, the trapped air molecules began to resonate with the sound waves and vibrate violently. This increased the pressure on the film, inflating it and eventually creating a bubble. The team explored two alternative ways to manipulate the film shape: pulling the centre with a needle and passing a ring around the edge of the film. Both attempts were successful in producing bubbles.

Robat is a four-wheeled autonomous robot, equipped with a speaker to mimic a bat\u2019s mouth, and two microphones, positioned on the left and right, to mimic a bat\u2019s ears. As it moves around, Robat\u2019s speakers produce a high-frequency chirp every half a metre. It can then identify the position of obstacles by calculating the delay between making this sound and the echo returning, and any differences between the two microphones. This is known as echolocation and bats use the same technique when flying in the dark. To put Robat to the test, Yossi Yovel at Tel Aviv University in Israel, and his colleagues placed it in one of two greenhouses in a botanical garden. Robat was then able to drive through the plant-lined paths avoiding obstacles, such as a bucket and a chair, while drawing a map of the surroundings. Bats are also likely able to identify specific objects using echolocation, so Yovel and his team gave Robat an algorithm to classify if something was a plant or not.

On April 1 2017, Reddit launched Place, a collaborative art project. Users could edit any single pixel on a 1000 by 1000 square, choosing from a palette of 16 colours. After editing a pixel, they had to wait between 5 and 20 minutes before they could place another. In the 72 hours that followed, over a million people battled for control of the canvas, painting thousands of mascots, logos, Pok\u00e9mon, images, patterns, memes, affiliations, and a lot of national flags. In Place, Thomas M\u00fcller and James Winters at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History spotted an opportunity to study cultural evolution \u2013 how ideas grow and disseminate. Cultural evolutionary theory suggests that as ideas and behaviours are shared, they start to adopt more predictable patterns. This is driven by two factors: increasing homogeneity, such as standardised spellings, and by setting rules for their use, such as grammar. M\u00fcller and Winters used the theory to predict\u00a0that after an initial increase in complexity, Place should simplify over time. The data bore this out, with file size \u2013 a marker of complexity \u2013 peaking around the 30-hour mark and decreasing steadily thereafter. This happened because early artists could generally spread out to avoid one another, making Place chaotic, but as the canvas filled up, structure emerged and artworks depended on maintaining these borders to survive. Users soon formed clans that were dedicated to creating and enlarging their chosen artworks, and protecting them against incursion and vandalism from other teams. The interplay between growing complexity provided by different users, and the structure provided by a set of commonly agreed rules, mirrors how cultural phenomena as diverse as language, art, and heraldry establish order within themselves. \u201cCulture is complicated to study, but you can derive the underlying principles on how it changes through time,\u201d says Winters.

No matter how clean you try to make something a thin layer of molecules always ends up coating the surface, but identifying them can be tricky. To learn more, Ulrike Diebold at the Vienna University of Technology and colleagues investigated when a piece of titanium dioxide would become dirty under controlled conditions. There were several theories about what the dirt might be, including a new form of ice or carbonic acid from the air. \u201cThere were four papers from four teams, all with different explanations, and all of them were wrong,\u201d says Diebold. In an ultra-high vacuum chamber the team tested different suspects. These included arguably the world\u2019s cleanest water, made by further purifying commercially available ultrapure water, soda water \u2013 a mixture of carbon dioxide and water, and air. Only exposure to air resulted in molecular dirt accumulating on the surface of the titanium dioxide. A chemical analysis revealed why: the smut is made of acetic acid and formic acid. Produced by plants, they are only present in a few parts per billion in air. But their chemistry gives them a strong affinity for titanium dioxide. Diebold says this patina may contribute to the material\u2019s self-cleaning properties.
